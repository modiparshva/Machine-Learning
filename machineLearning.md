## Q3. Concepts of Regression  

### a) Define regression and its purpose  

- **Regression** is a supervised learning technique used to predict **continuous values** by modeling the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs.  

- **Purpose:**  
  - Forecast **future trends** (sales, prices, demand).

- House price prediction (size, location, age).  
- Sales forecasting for future revenue.  
- Medical dosage calculation (patient data).  
- Stock price forecasting (market indicators).  

### c) Difference between simple regression and multiple regression  

| Aspect               | Simple Regression                     | Multiple Regression                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Number of predictors | One independent variable             | Two or more independent variables        |
| Equation             | \( y = a + bx \)                    | \( y = a + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n \) |
| Complexity           | Easier, interpretable relationship   | More complex, combines multiple effects   |
| Use case             | Effect of one feature on outcome     | Impact of several features on outcome     |

- **Simple Regression** focuses on the relation between *one variable and the output*.  
- **Multiple Regression** includes *many input variables* for more accurate predictions.

## Q4. Concepts of Classification

### a) Define classification and give examples of real-world classification problems.

- Classification is a supervised learning task where the model assigns input data into predefined categories or classes.
- It predicts discrete labels based on input features.
- Examples:  
  - Email spam detection (spam or not spam)  
  - Medical diagnosis (disease present or absent)  
  - Image recognition (identifying objects like cats, dogs)  
  - Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral text classification)

### b) Explain the concept of decision boundaries with a neat diagram.

- A decision boundary is a surface (line in 2D, plane in 3D) that separates different classes in the feature space.
- It helps the classifier decide on which side a new data point falls to assign a class label.
- Types of decision boundaries:  
  - Linear (straight line/plane) for simple separable data  
  - Non-linear (curved) for complex data  


### c) Differentiate between binary and multi-class classification problems.

| Aspect              | Binary Classification                   | Multi-class Classification              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Number of Classes   | Exactly 2 classes                       | More than 2 classes                     |
| Examples           | Spam vs Not Spam, Fraud vs Legitimate  | Handwritten digit recognition (0-9)   |
| Decision Boundary  | Single dividing line or surface         | Multiple boundaries separating classes |
| Complexity         | Relatively simpler                       | More complex decision rules            |
| Common Algorithms   | Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes  | One-vs-Rest, Softmax regression, Decision Trees |

## Q5. Concepts of Clustering

### a) Define clustering and its significance in unsupervised learning.

- **Clustering** is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters such that points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than those in different clusters.
- It helps discover **hidden patterns** and **natural groupings** in unlabeled data.
- Significant for **data exploration**, **pattern recognition**, and **reducing data complexity** without prior knowledge of the categories.

### b) Explain at least two clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) with diagrams.

**1. K-Means Clustering**  
- Divides data into *k* clusters by assigning each point to the nearest cluster centroid and iteratively updating centroids.  
- It aims to minimize the variance within each cluster.

**2. Hierarchical Clustering**  
- Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) by either **agglomerative** (bottom-up) merging or **divisive** (top-down) splitting of clusters.  
- Does not require pre-specifying the number of clusters.


### c) Provide at least two application areas where clustering is widely used.

- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on buying behavior for targeted marketing.  
- **Image Segmentation:** Dividing an image into meaningful regions for object detection.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual data points in fraud detection or network security.  
- **Market Research:** Understanding natural groupings of consumer preferences.

## Q6. Case Study / Application-Based Question

- **Type of ML:** Supervised Learning (Regression)  
- **Input Features:** Historical stock prices, trading volume, market indicators (P/E ratio, market cap), economic indicators (interest rates, GDP), company financial metrics.  
- **Expected Output:** Predicted stock price (continuous numerical value)  
- **Algorithms:**  
  1. Linear Regression for simple predictions  
  2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for capturing sequential dependencies in time-series data  
  3. Random Forest Regression for handling non-linear relationships  
- **Justification:**  
  - LSTM is especially suitable because stock prices depend heavily on past temporal patterns, which LSTMs capture well  
  - Random Forest can handle complex features and reduce overfitting  
- **Key Challenges:**  
  - Market volatility and unpredictability due to external events (news, political changes) make long-term predictions difficult

### 2. Limitations of Machine Learning

- **Data Dependency:** Machine Learning models require large amounts of high-quality, relevant data to perform well. Limited or poor-quality data leads to inaccurate or biased results.
- **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Models can either memorize training data too closely (overfitting) or fail to capture underlying patterns (underfitting), reducing generalization to new data.
- **Bias and Fairness:** ML models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, resulting in unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
- **Computational Cost:** Training complex models requires significant computational resources and time, which may not be feasible for all applications.

### 3. Ethical Concerns and Bias in ML Systems

- Ethical concerns in machine learning revolve around fairness, transparency, and privacy.
- Bias in training data or algorithms can lead to unfair or discriminatory decisions impacting individuals or groups.
- Lack of explainability makes it hard to trust or audit ML decisions.
- Privacy issues arise when sensitive data is misused or improperly handled.
- Addressing these concerns requires careful data collection, algorithm design, transparency, and ongoing monitoring to ensure responsible and fair AI systems.
